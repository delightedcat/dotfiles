# dotfiles

My preferred development machine and project configurations files.
I use the [Darkbox](https://github.com/delightedcat/darkbox-gtk.git) desktop theme and patched [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) font.

## Text Editor

My editor of choice is [GruvArt](https://github.com/delightedcat/gruvart).
It's my personal preconfigured set of Neovim plugins and settings.

## Layout

- `avatars` - A bunch of image files that I use as avatars across the internet;
- `backgrounds` - A set of backgrounds that I use on the desktop;
- `fish` - My configuration file(s) for the Fish shell;
- `gentoo` - My Gentoo-specific configuration file such as kernel configs and Portage files;
- `gtk-3.0` - Custom GTK 3.0 settings - should be copied into `~/.config/gtk-3.0`;
- `guides` - Some guides I use for myself as a quick reference;
- `scripts` - Scripts to ease up some day-to-day tasks or automate server things;
- `themes` - Mostly GTK desktop themes that I use on the desktop;
- `xfce4` - Some of my custom Xfce4 configuration files.

**DISCLAIMER:** None of the scripts located in the `scripts` directory come with any kind of warranty.
Moreoever I'm not responsible for any damage done by any of said scripts.
